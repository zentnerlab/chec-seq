# chec-seq
Scripts used for processing and analysis of ChEC-seq data in Zentner et al, Nature Communications 2015.  Some can also be used for ChIP-seq and MNase-seq data.  Detailed usage information can be found in each script.

All scripts were written by Siva Kasinathan of the Henikoff Lab at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (skasin@uw.edu).
